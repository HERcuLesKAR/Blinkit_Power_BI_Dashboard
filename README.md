# Blinkit_Power_BI_Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard for analyzing Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. It includes comprehensive visualizations, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and insights aimed at optimizing business strategies and performance.

## Project Overview

The Blinkit Sales and Inventory Dashboard uses Power BI to present an in-depth analysis of various business metrics, including total sales, average sales, item performance, and customer ratings. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights by evaluating data across different dimensions, such as fat content, outlet type, location, and size.

## Business Requirements

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit’s operations through the following business requirements:

- **Sales Performance:** Evaluate total sales, average sales, and item performance.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Analyze customer ratings across various product categories.
- **Inventory Distribution:** Assess inventory distribution by outlet size, location, and type.

### Key KPIs

- **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
- **Average Sales:** The average revenue per sale.
- **Number of Items Sold:** The total count of different items sold.
- **Average Rating:** The average customer rating for items sold.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes several visualizations, including charts that help to analyze the relationship between sales performance and key attributes:

1. **Total Sales by Fat Content (Donut Chart):** Analyze how fat content impacts total sales.
2. **Total Sales by Item Type (Bar Chart):** Compare the performance of different item types.
3. **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales (Stacked Column Chart):** Compare total sales across outlets segmented by fat content.
4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment (Line Chart):** Evaluate how outlet age/type influences sales.
5. **Sales by Outlet Size (Donut/Pie Chart):** Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.
6. **Sales by Outlet Location (Funnel Map):** Assess sales across different geographic locations.
7. **All Metrics by Outlet Type (Matrix Card):** Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics by outlet type.
